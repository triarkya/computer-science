# computer-science
just a collection of different things in computer science

# Automata

## DFA
    - create DFA from a set of transitions (state_a, transition, state_b)
    - run the DFA on input

# Data Structures 

## BST (Binary Search Tree)
    - create BST by passing each node in the intended order
    - print the BST (image generation will be added later)
    
## Treap
    - create Treap from set af priority: key combinations
    - modify Treap by deleting/adding Treap nodes
    - print the Treap (image generation will be added later)
    
## Searching Algorithms
    - binary search
    
## Sorting Algorithms
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort
