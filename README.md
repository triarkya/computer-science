# computer-science
just a collection of different things in computer science

# Automata

## DFA
    - create DFA from a set of transitions (state_a, transition, state_b)
    - run the DFA on input

# Data Structures 

## BST (Binary Search Tree)
In a binary search tree, the left child is a smaller node than the current node and the right child is a larger node. A node is only inserted as a child if the currently visited node does not have a right or left child. Otherwise, the respective child is set as the new current node until the respective child does not exist.

    - create BST by passing each node in the intended order
    - print the BST
    - image generation as .png (graphviz package needed)

## Treap
A treap is similar to a binary search tree with the difference that the nodes are inserted in ascending priority order.

    - create Treap from set af priority: key combinations
    - modify Treap by deleting/adding Treap nodes
    - print the Treap
    - image generation as .png (graphviz package needed)
